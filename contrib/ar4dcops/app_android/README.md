# App-Android

An Augmented Reality (AR) based app that runs on Android systems to aid data center maintenance and audit work. It obtains data from
the back-end server Flowgate, which integrates all the information related to a specific data
center, and displays necessary information onto real scenes" in the data center using AR
technology.

Note:

Some problems remain before our project period ends. The app might not be very stable because of compability issues (the packages we 
use might have some conflicts with ARcore). It may run smoothly 
on some Android devices but can crash frequently on some other types of devices. Also, its features are not as comprehensive as the 
IOS version. We hope that future developers can try to improve the solution.
