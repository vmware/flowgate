# 
Project FlowGate is an open source vendor-neutral project helps enterprises integrate facility systems data and IT data to form a single holistic view of their operations. By combining these two disparate data sets into one view, data center managers are better equipped to optimize operations and make smarter choices about workload placement.
With Project Flowgate, we can fetch metadata and runtime metrics from various facility systems like DCIM and CMDB (Configuration Management Database), process the data from IT systems, correlate both together, and then push the results to IT infrastructure management and operation management systems. In that way, IT administrators can see updated data from facilities for IT assets in one single pane of glass. They can also view and analyze additional resources such as: power supply, cooling capacity, temperature/moisture situation for every specific server, and conduct many “facility-awared” operations, which were previously impossible.

# Why
* In enterprise data centers, IT infrastructure and facility are generally managed separately, which leads to information gaps.
* Collaboration between facility and IT infrastructure systems are limited or manual, and virtualization adds more complexity.
* More and more workloads move into off prime colos or clouds where infrastructure are managed via outsourcing, making more gaps.
* Sound IT operations management and automation decisions may not be the best choice if not consider power, cooling or environmental constrains. 
## Features
* **Built-in adapter for multiple DCIM and CMDB system integration.** 
  - Nlyte
